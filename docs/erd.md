# m:n movies-users

## requirement

- The movies list is the same for all users - modify the schema and your server code so that each user has their own list of movies.

 User ||--o{ MoviesOnUsers : has
 Movie ||--|{ MoviesOnUsers : has

 User {
  Int           id           PK
  String        username      
  String        password
  Array         movies  
  DateTime      createdAt    
  DateTime      updatedAt    
}

 Movie {
  Int       id               PK
  Int       userId           FK
  String    title              
  String    description   
  Int       runtimeMins   
  DateTime  createdAt         
  DateTime  updatedAt         
}

 MoviesOnUsers {
    Int       userId          FK
    Int       movieId         FK
    Boolean   favourite
    String    note
    Int       personalRating
    DateTime  assignedAt
 }

```

## notes

- everyone visiting the page can see the current list of all the movies added
- a logged in user can see their own personal list as well
- a logged in user can edit their own personal list
- when the former happens, if the movie does not already exists in the db, create it
- ... if it already exists, simply add it to that user's personal list
